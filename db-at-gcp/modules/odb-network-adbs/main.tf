# ODB Network for Autonomous AI Database Serverless only.
#
# Identical to modules/odb-network except that it creates NO backup subnet: the
# backup subnet is used by Exadata VM Clusters and never by an Autonomous
# Database, so a network serving only ADB-S does not need one.
#
# This is a separate module rather than a flag on odb-network on purpose.
# Terraform cannot make a resource conditional without changing its address, so
# putting a count on the backup subnet would rewrite
# google_oracle_database_odb_subnet.backup to ...backup[0] in every existing
# configuration — a state move, and a proposed destroy of a live backup subnet
# for anyone who had already applied. Networks in gcp_odb_networks keep the
# original module, byte for byte.
